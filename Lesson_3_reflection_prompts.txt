Q-When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Ans- Whenever I would like to share the code base with multiple people.

Q-Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Ans- Local work might get override because of automatic updation.
